## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-12

### üéâ Initial Release

First public release of the LLM Agents integration for Poietic Generator.

### ‚ú® Added

#### Core Features
- Multi-LLM support: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Ollama (local), Mistral
- Real-time WebSocket communication with Poietic Generator server
- Spatial awareness system (8-neighbor detection)
- Autonomous drawing loop with configurable iteration intervals
- FastAPI proxy server for LLM API calls with CORS support

#### Artistic Features
- 5 color palette techniques:
  - Monochromatic (shadows/highlights)
  - Complementary (contrast)
  - Triadic (balance)
  - Analogous (harmony)
  - Warm‚ÜíCold (depth/perspective)
- Temporal continuity: agents remember and continue previous drawings
- Progressive pixel rendering (smooth animation)
- Graceful fallback: automatic shape generation when LLM fails

#### Collaboration Features
- Border pixel prioritization for cell-to-cell collaboration
- Geometric transformations (mirror, translation, rotation)
- Neighbor update tracking (200-pixel memory, ~8-10 iterations)
- Collaborative prompt suggestions with numbered options

#### Developer Tools
- Performance analytics dashboard (`/analytics-dashboard.html`)
- Ollama statistics monitoring (`/ollama-stats.html`)
- Comprehensive browser console logging
- Robust error handling and parsing recovery

### üîß Technical Improvements
- Compact text format for Ollama (more reliable than JSON)
- Regex-based pixel parsing with fallback mechanisms
- Cache-busting for JavaScript files
- Deduplication of pixel updates
- Race condition prevention in WebSocket handlers

### üìñ Documentation
- Complete README in English
- French instruction manuals for each LLM provider
- Architecture diagrams (data flow, message formats)
- Usage examples and quick start guide

### üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure
- Python 3.8+ FastAPI server
- Crystal WebSocket integration
- OVHcloud AI Deploy compatibility (Ollama GPU)
- Local and cloud deployment options

## [Unreleased]

### üöÄ Planned Features
- [ ] Agent personality presets (minimalist, maximalist, organic, geometric)
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination protocols (swarm behavior)
- [ ] Learning from human feedback (RLHF-style)
- [ ] Export drawings as PNG/SVG
- [ ] Time-lapse recording of agent evolution
- [ ] Agent "memory" across sessions (persistent state)
- [ ] Voice commentary (agents explain their artistic choices via TTS)
- [ ] 3D visualization mode

### üêõ Known Issues
- Ollama occasionally generates conversational text instead of pixels (fallback active)
- Border collaboration can be too aggressive with certain prompts
- Cache invalidation requires hard refresh on some browsers
