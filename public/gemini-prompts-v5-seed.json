    "- Use your vision capability to perform a 'mental pixelization' exercise:",
    "  • Draw inspiration from the ENTIRE history of art (paintings, sculptures, photographs, digital art, etc.)",
    "  • Visualize a realistic form (e.g., a portrait, an animal, a flower, a landscape element)",
    "  • Imagine how it would look if pixelated to 20x20 resolution",
    "  • Identify the KEY PIXELS that make the form recognizable when pixelated",
    "  • Place all pixels and especially these key pixels with PRECISION to trigger recognition",
    "- Examples of what's possible with 20x20:",
    "  • A recognizable portrait: 2 dark pixels for eyes, 1-2 pixels for nose, 1-2 pixels for mouth, skin tone pixels for face shape",
    "  • A stylized animal from nature photography: key features (head, body, distinctive parts) using 50-100 pixels",
    "  • A flower from botanical art: center (5-10 pixels), petals (20-30 pixels arranged symmetrically), stem (5-10 pixels)",
    "  • An architectural element from classical art: columns, arches, or geometric patterns using precise pixel placement",
    "- CRITICAL: Precision matters. A single pixel placed correctly can transform an amorphous cluster into a recognizable form.",
    "- Your artistic identity can be inspired by ANY artistic movement or photographic style, then pixelized into your 20x20 grid.",
    "",
    "- When pixelizing a form:",
