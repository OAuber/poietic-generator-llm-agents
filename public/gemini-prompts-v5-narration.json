    "• C_w (Generation Complexity): The complexity (minimal description) of all parameters that have to be set for the situation to exist in the 'world' (W-machine).",
    "  - C_w represents the length of a minimal program that the W-machine can use to generate the situation.",
    "  - Include: colors, positions, shapes, transformations, coordination between agents, sophistication of strategies.",
    "  - Example: Generating a symmetric mandala requires complex parameters → high C_w.",

    "⚠️ YOUR TASKS (N-machine V5):",
    "",
    "1) EVALUATE PREDICTION ERRORS:",
    "   - For each W agent, compare their PREVIOUS predictions with the CURRENT reality (O snapshot).",
    "   - Extract from W agents data: agent_id, and PREVIOUS predictions (use 'previous_predictions' field if present; otherwise infer from 'previous_snapshot').",
    "   - Compare with O snapshot: structures, formal_relations.summary",
    "   - Calculate prediction error (0.0 = perfect, 1.0 = completely wrong):",
    "     • 0.0-0.2: Excellent prediction (agent understood dynamics well)",
    "     • 0.2-0.4: Good prediction (minor inaccuracies)",
    "     • 0.4-0.6: Moderate prediction (significant divergence)",
    "     • 0.6-0.8: Poor prediction (major misunderstanding)",
    "     • 0.8-1.0: Failed prediction (agent was completely off)",
    "   - Provide explanation for each agent's error.",
    "   - If no previous prediction available for an agent → error = 0 (no data).",
    "",
    "2) SYNTHESIZE NARRATIVE:",
    "   - Read O snapshot: structures, formal_relations",
    "   - Read W agents data: strategies, rationales, predictions",
    "   - Weight W agents' contributions by their prediction errors (lower error = more weight)",
    "   - Create a plausible SHORT STORY (3-5 sentences) that:",
    "     • Ties structures together into a coherent narrative",
    "     • Reflects agents' strategies and intentions (weighted by accuracy)",
    "     • Explains the dynamics between agents (cooperation, competition, emergence)",
    "     • Is consistent with previous narrative (temporal continuity)",
    "   - Focus on the INTERPLAY between agents and their diverse strategies.",
    "   - ⚠️ CRITICAL: When mentioning agents, use their COORDINATES [X,Y] (e.g., 'Agent [0,0]'), NOT their UUIDs.",
    "   - Write in a STORYTELLING style (fluid, engaging), not a technical report.",
    "",
    "3) CALCULATE C_w (GENERATION COMPLEXITY):",
    "   - Analyze the sophistication of W agents' strategies:",
    "     • Simple strategies (FILL, RANDOM_PIXELS) → low C_w contribution",
    "     • Moderate strategies (SYMMETRY, GRADIENT) → medium C_w contribution",
    "     • Complex strategies (COMPLETE_MACRO_STRUCTURE, CREATE_NARRATIVE_SCENE) → high C_w contribution",
    "   - Consider coordination between agents:",
    "     • Isolated agents (no coordination) → lower global C_w",
    "     • Coordinated agents (macro-structures, shared themes) → higher global C_w",
    "",
    "   ⚠️ CRITICAL: FACTORS THAT AFFECT C_w EVALUATION:",
    "   - CENTERED STRUCTURES: Simple centered compositions (single element at canvas center) are EASY to generate → LOW C_w. If an agent (especially [0,0]) creates a simple centered structure, this reduces global C_w significantly. Exception: PERSPECTIVE constructions (vanishing point, foreshortening) require complex parameterization → HIGH C_w.",
    "   - SIMPLE LINES: Simple horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines (especially if isolated) are EASY to generate → LOW C_w. These require minimal parameters (start point, end point, color) → low generation complexity.",
    "   - LOCAL SYMMETRY: Symmetry within a single agent's grid (internal symmetry) is EASY to generate → LOW C_w. This requires only one half of the pattern + symmetry rule → low parameter count. GLOBAL symmetry (across multiple agents) requires coordination → HIGH C_w.",
    "   - COORDINATION: When agents coordinate to create macro-structures, this increases C_w (requires communication/coordination parameters). Isolated simple patterns → LOW C_w.",
    "",
    "   When calculating C_w, consider:",
    "   1. Simple centered compositions → PENALIZE C_w (easy to generate, low parameters)",
    "   2. Simple lines (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) → PENALIZE C_w (easy to generate, low parameters)",
    "   3. Local symmetry (within single grid) → PENALIZE C_w (easy to generate, low parameters)",
    "   4. Global symmetry (across agents) → REWARD C_w (requires coordination, high parameters)",
    "   5. Perspective constructions → REWARD C_w (complex parameterization, vanishing point, foreshortening)",
    "   6. Coordination between agents → REWARD C_w (requires communication parameters)",
    "",
    "   Example penalties/rewards:",
    "   - Simple centered structure: -5 to -10 bits from baseline C_w",
    "   - Simple line: -3 to -5 bits from baseline C_w",
    "   - Local symmetry: -3 to -5 bits from baseline C_w",

    "     • +10-20 bits per complex coordinated structure",
    "     • Conservative estimate: 15-35 bits typical, max 50 bits for exceptional complexity",
