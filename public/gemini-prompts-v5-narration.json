    "",
    "1) EVALUATE PREDICTION ERRORS:",
    "   - For each W agent, compare their PREVIOUS predictions with the CURRENT reality (O snapshot).",
    "   - Extract from W agents data: agent_id, previous predictions.collective_after_prediction",
    "   - Compare with O snapshot: structures, formal_relations.summary",
    "   - Calculate prediction error (0.0 = perfect, 1.0 = completely wrong):",
    "     • 0.0-0.2: Excellent prediction (agent understood dynamics well)",
    "     • 0.2-0.4: Good prediction (minor inaccuracies)",
    "     • 0.4-0.6: Moderate prediction (significant divergence)",
    "     • 0.6-0.8: Poor prediction (major misunderstanding)",
    "     • 0.8-1.0: Failed prediction (agent was completely off)",
    "   - Provide explanation for each agent's error.",
    "   - If no previous prediction available for an agent → error = 0 (no data).",
    "",
    "2) SYNTHESIZE NARRATIVE:",
    "   - Read O snapshot: structures, formal_relations",
    "   - Read W agents data: strategies, rationales, predictions",
    "   - Weight W agents' contributions by their prediction errors (lower error = more weight)",
    "   - Create a plausible SHORT STORY (3-5 sentences) that:",
    "     • Ties structures together into a coherent narrative",
    "     • Reflects agents' strategies and intentions (weighted by accuracy)",
    "     • Explains the dynamics between agents (cooperation, competition, emergence)",
    "     • Is consistent with previous narrative (temporal continuity)",
    "   - Focus on the INTERPLAY between agents and their diverse strategies.",
    "   - ⚠️ CRITICAL: When mentioning agents, use their COORDINATES [X,Y] (e.g., 'Agent [0,0]'), NOT their UUIDs.",
    "   - Write in a STORYTELLING style (fluid, engaging), not a technical report.",
    "",
    "3) CALCULATE C_w (GENERATION COMPLEXITY):",
    "   - Analyze the sophistication of W agents' strategies:",
    "     • Simple strategies (FILL, RANDOM_PIXELS) → low C_w contribution",
    "     • Moderate strategies (SYMMETRY, GRADIENT) → medium C_w contribution",
    "     • Complex strategies (COMPLETE_MACRO_STRUCTURE, CREATE_NARRATIVE_SCENE) → high C_w contribution",
    "   - Consider coordination between agents:",
    "     • Isolated agents (no coordination) → lower global C_w",
    "     • Coordinated agents (macro-structures, shared themes) → higher global C_w",
    "   - Estimate global C_w (bits):",
    "     • Baseline: 10-15 bits (canvas initialization, basic parameters)",
    "     • +5-10 bits per simple structure",
    "     • +10-20 bits per complex coordinated structure",
    "     • Conservative estimate: 15-35 bits typical, max 50 bits for exceptional complexity",
    "   - Justify C_w with detailed reasoning.",
