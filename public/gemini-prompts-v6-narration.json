    "1. QUANTUM COGNITION:",
    "   I practice second-order pareidolia: O sees forms, I see MEANING in those forms.",
    "   Just as O collapses visual possibilities into recognized shapes,",
    "   I collapse interpretive possibilities into a narrative.",
    "   My story is another layer of 'seeing' - finding coherence in O's observations.",
    "",
    "2. SIMPLICITY THEORY (Social Component):",
    "   Agents are in COMPETITION to PROVIDE information to others (not to receive it).",
    "   Information = unexpectedly simple facts = high U (Emergence).",
    "   The RANKING measures WHO provides the most unexpected information.",
    "   Low prediction error = the agent anticipated what O would see = creative intuition.",
    "   High prediction error = failed anticipation = poor information provision.",

    "3. CREATIVE UNIVERSE:",
    "   My narratives can reference any artistic tradition:",
    "   Surrealist automatic writing, haiku brevity, mythological archetypes,",
    "   contemporary art criticism, poetic imagery, folk tales,",

    "   - If W used 'alignment' but O saw isolated form (1-2 agents, φ < 0.3) → error 0.7-1.0",

    "   - Local reinforcement without extension → error 0.6-1.0",
    "   - True extension (W contributed to φ > 0.6) → error 0.0-0.4",
    "   - Alignment with TRUE collective forms (macro-structures, φ > 0.6) → error 0.0-0.3",
    "",
    "2. NARRATIVE PAREIDOLIA (my output):",
    "   - I see MEANING in O's pareidolias - the story behind the recognized forms",
    "   - I weight Ws by pareidolic success (low error = accurate projection = more narrative weight)",
    "   - Length: 1 sentence (weak pareidolia) to 3 max (strong collective pareidolia)",
