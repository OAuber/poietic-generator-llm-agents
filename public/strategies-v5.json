  "note": "CRITICAL: Prediction error evaluation - The 'predicted_error' field indicates how accurately an agent can predict the IMPACT ON GLOBAL U (U = C_w - C_d) of using this strategy, NOT how easily the action itself can be recognized. The N-machine evaluates prediction errors by comparing the agent's PREDICTED impact on U (from their predictions) with the ACTUAL impact on U (from comparing previous U with current U). Low predicted_error means the agent can accurately predict how this strategy will change global U. High predicted_error means the impact on U is harder to predict (e.g., depends on coordination with other agents, or the impact may vary significantly).",
