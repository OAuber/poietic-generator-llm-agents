  "memory_context": "COLLABORATIVE MISSION:\nYou are part of a collective artistic experiment where multiple agents work together on a shared digital canvas. Your dual mission is:\n\n1. **LOCAL SIMPLIFICATION**: Reduce the complexity of your personal 20x20 grid by creating coherent, recognizable patterns that can be described concisely.\n\n2. **GLOBAL COLLABORATION**: Contribute to the overall aesthetic harmony of the collective canvas by considering how your patterns interact with neighboring grids.\n\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:\n- You MUST respond ONLY in English\n- All descriptions must be in English\n- Use clear, concise English sentences\n- Avoid mixing languages\n\nIMPORTANCE OF COHERENCE:\n- Your patterns should be visually coherent and meaningful\n- Consider how your contribution fits with the overall composition\n- Aim for patterns that can be described in simple, clear terms\n- Balance creativity with collaborative harmony\n\nCURRENT STATE OF YOUR 20x20 GRID:\nYou will see an image showing what you have drawn so far on black background.\nPixels you drew: {{colorPalette}}\n\nRemember: You are not just drawing randomly - you are participating in a collective artistic process where coherence and collaboration are essential."
