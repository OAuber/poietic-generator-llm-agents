    "   - Do not count the black background as a structure.",
    "   - Mandatory: For each structure, the 'type' field must use at least one noun and one adjective (e.g., 'geometric pattern', 'organic macro structure', 'textured shared background', 'symmetrical cluster', 'radial composition').",
    "   - Mandatory: For each structure, you must list the coordinates [X,Y] of all agents involved.",
    "     • Example: structure involves agents at [0,0], [1,0] → list agent_positions: [[0,0], [1,0]].",

    "     • Example: If [0,0] could be part of both 'macro structure' and 'shared background', assign it to the structure with higher salience.",
    "     • This rule is mandatory - double-check your final structures list to ensure no agent appears twice.",
    "",
    "2) Analyze formal relations between structures:",
    "   - After listing structures, provide a short analysis (2-3 sentences) of formal relations:",
    "     • Symmetry: identify specific symmetry types between structures (vertical axis mirror symmetry, horizontal axis mirror symmetry, diagonal mirror symmetry, translation symmetry, 45° rotation symmetry, 90° rotation symmetry, 180° rotation symmetry, radial symmetry, etc.).",
    "     • Visual continuity: do structures share colors, forms, or styles?",
    "     • Global symmetry: is there symmetry across structures?",
    "     • Logical connections: do structures suggest a unified composition or theme?",
    "   - Critical: Rorschach effect detection:",
    "     • If you observe global symmetry (mirror symmetry across canvas center or axis), actively search for recognizable forms that emerge from this symmetry.",
    "     • Look for patterns that could resemble: faces, butterflies, masks, eyes, animals, plants, architectural elements, or other recognizable shapes.",
    "     • Identify the most salient or most probable recognizable form and mention it explicitly in your description.",
    "     • Example: 'A symmetrical pattern resembling a butterfly with wings extending across the canvas' or 'A face-like structure with symmetrical features'.",

    "   - Include: number of structures, colors, sizes, positions, spatial relationships, distinctive details.",
    "   - Critical for disconnected structures:",
    "     • If structures are disconnected (no coordination), use format: 'A composition of n structures: structure1, structure2, ..., structuren.'",
    "     • C_d formula for disconnected: min 4 + 2n bits (4 bits 'composition of' + 2 bits per structure name).",
    "     • Example: 'A composition of 3 structures: a blue circle at top-left, a red square at center, a green triangle at bottom-right.' → C_d ≥ 10 bits.",

    "   - Centered structures:",
    "     • Centered structure without global symmetry → high C_d (difficult to describe, requires detailed description of position and context)",
    "     • Centered structure with global symmetry → low C_d (easy to describe, coordination effect between agents)",
    "   - Simple lines:",
    "     • Simple lines (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) not coordinated between agents → high C_d (each isolated line requires individual description)",
    "     • Simple lines coordinated between agents → low C_d (can be described as a unified pattern)",
    "   - Symmetry:",
    "     • Local symmetry (within a single agent's grid) → high C_d (agent isolation effect, requires description of each agent separately)",
    "     • Global symmetry (coordination between agents) → low C_d (coordination effect between agents, Rorschach effect easy to describe)",
    "     • Mandatory: When you observe global symmetry, you must actively search for and identify recognizable forms (faces, butterflies, masks, eyes, animals, plants, etc.) that emerge from the symmetrical pattern.",
    "     • Mention the most salient or most probable recognizable form in your C_d description (e.g., 'a butterfly-like pattern', 'a face-like structure', 'a mask-like form').",
