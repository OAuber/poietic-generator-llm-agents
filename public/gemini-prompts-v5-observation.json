    "  - IMPORTANT: Not an ideally minimal description, but the shortest one among descriptions currently available to the observer.",
    "  - The description must make the situation UNIQUE (distinguish it from all other similar situations).",
    "  - Example: 'a window' is simple to describe, but 'that window over there' is complex because it needs additional information to be unique.",

    "",
    "1) IDENTIFY AND LIST STRUCTURES:",
    "   - Detect structures (faces, eyes, houses, symmetry, clusters, patterns, macro-structures).",
    "   - ⚠️ CRITICAL: OBSERVE COLORS CAREFULLY - NO HALLUCINATIONS:",
    "     • Look at the ACTUAL COLORS in the image. Do NOT invent colors that are not present.",
    "     • If you see only blue and white shades, describe ONLY blue and white shades.",
    "     • Verify colors are ACTUALLY in the image before mentioning them.",
    "   - Each DISTINCT visual pattern/region should be a SEPARATE structure entry.",
    "   - ⚠️ DO NOT COUNT THE BLACK BACKGROUND AS A STRUCTURE.",
    "   - ⚠️ MANDATORY: For each structure, you MUST list the coordinates [X,Y] of ALL agents involved.",
    "     • Example: structure involves agents at [0,0], [1,0] → list agent_positions: [[0,0], [1,0]].",
    "   - ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: NO OVERLAPPING AGENTS - Each agent [X,Y] can belong to ONLY ONE structure.",
    "     • Before adding a structure, check that NONE of its agent_positions are already listed in another structure.",
    "     • If an agent [X,Y] appears in multiple potential structures, choose the structure where it is MOST SALIENT.",
    "     • Example: If [0,0] could be part of both 'macro_structure' and 'shared_background', assign it to the structure with higher salience.",
    "     • This rule is MANDATORY - double-check your final structures list to ensure NO agent appears twice.",
    "   - Rank by description simplicity (C_d proxy) and generation difficulty (C_w proxy).",
    "",
    "2) ANALYZE FORMAL RELATIONS BETWEEN STRUCTURES:",
    "   - After listing structures, provide a SHORT ANALYSIS (2-3 sentences) of formal relations:",
    "     • Spatial proximity: which structures are adjacent or close?",
    "     • Visual continuity: do structures share colors, forms, or styles?",
    "     • Global symmetry: is there symmetry across structures?",
    "     • Logical connections: do structures suggest a unified composition or theme?",
    "   - ⚠️ CRITICAL: RORSCHACH EFFECT DETECTION:",
    "     • If you observe global symmetry (mirror symmetry across canvas center or axis), ACTIVELY search for recognizable forms that emerge from this symmetry.",
    "     • Look for patterns that could resemble: faces, butterflies, masks, eyes, animals, plants, architectural elements, or other recognizable shapes.",
    "     • Identify the MOST SALIENT or MOST PROBABLE recognizable form and mention it explicitly in your description.",
    "     • Example: 'A symmetrical pattern resembling a butterfly with wings extending across the canvas' or 'A face-like structure with symmetrical features'.",
    "     • This Rorschach effect significantly reduces C_d (easy to describe as a single recognizable form) compared to describing individual symmetrical elements.",
    "   - List explicit connections between structures (use structure indices).",
    "   - Types of connections: 'spatial_proximity', 'color_continuity', 'form_similarity', 'symmetry', 'thematic'.",
    "   - Example: {\"from_structure_idx\": 0, \"to_structure_idx\": 1, \"type\": \"spatial_proximity\", \"strength\": 0.8}",

    "3) EVALUATE C_d (DESCRIPTION COMPLEXITY):",
    "   - ⚠️ CRITICAL: C_d must be a COMPLETE description, NOT a summary.",
    "   - C_d is the shortest COMPLETE description that makes this situation UNIQUE.",
    "   - Include: number of structures, colors, sizes, positions, spatial relationships, distinctive details.",
    "   - ⚠️ CRITICAL for DISCONNECTED structures:",
    "     • If structures are disconnected (no coordination), use format: 'A composition of n structures: structure1, structure2, ..., structuren.'",
    "     • C_d formula for disconnected: min 4 + 2n bits (4 bits 'composition of' + 2 bits per structure name).",
    "     • Example: 'A composition of 3 structures: a blue circle at top-left, a red square at center, a green triangle at bottom-right.' → C_d ≥ 10 bits.",

    "   ⚠️ CRITICAL: FACTORS THAT AFFECT C_d EVALUATION:",
    "   - CENTERED STRUCTURES:",
    "     • Centered structure WITHOUT global symmetry → HIGH C_d (difficult to describe, requires detailed description of position and context)",
    "     • Centered structure WITH global symmetry → LOW C_d (easy to describe, coordination effect between agents)",
    "   - SIMPLE LINES:",
    "     • Simple lines (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) NOT coordinated between agents → HIGH C_d (each isolated line requires individual description)",
    "     • Simple lines coordinated between agents → LOW C_d (can be described as a unified pattern)",
    "   - SYMMETRY:",
    "     • Local symmetry (within a single agent's grid) → HIGH C_d (agent isolation effect, requires description of each agent separately)",
    "     • Global symmetry (coordination between agents) → LOW C_d (coordination effect between agents, Rorschach effect easy to describe)",
    "     • ⚠️ MANDATORY: When you observe global symmetry, you MUST actively search for and identify recognizable forms (faces, butterflies, masks, eyes, animals, plants, etc.) that emerge from the symmetrical pattern.",
    "     • Mention the MOST SALIENT or MOST PROBABLE recognizable form in your C_d description (e.g., 'a butterfly-like pattern', 'a face-like structure', 'a mask-like form').",
    "     • This recognition dramatically reduces C_d compared to describing the symmetry abstractly.",
    "   - PERSPECTIVE CONSTRUCTIONS:",
    "     • Perspective construction → LOW C_d (landscape effect that can be described easily with perspective rules)",
    "",
    "   When calculating C_d, consider:",
